														<b>Hydrogen Fuel Cell Test Stations</b>
														<li>As hydrogen fuel cell technology advances, testing stations must equally advance so that new milestones can be reached.  
															I designed hydrogen fuel cell test stations for multiple Tier 1 manufacturers and universities, custom-tailored to meet each client's specific fuel cell testing needs.
															Each station is designed with utmost attention to equipment (control valves, vessels, etc) and piping.</li>

														<b>Control Valves</b>
														<li>I reverse-engineered and improved an existing design of a control valve.
															Upon receiving notice that the failure rate of this model was 2.37% in 2017,
															I applied Six Sigma problem solving principles to locate the problem and successfully applied design changes
															to reduce the failure rate to 0.37% in 2018.</li>

														<b>Level Controller</b>
														<li>I designed a new level controller to cater to a new market. 
															As this product is classified as a pressure containing product, I submitted a report application to the 
															regulatory body ABSA demonstrating design calculations and standards compliance to receive regulatory approval. 
															The product was successfully registered and a CRN was obtained</li>

														<b>Essential Mechanical Components </b>
														<li>As a Mechanical Engineer, I understand the principles and design of major essential mechanical components.
															I designed and manufactured these components according to their principle codes and standards, such as API and ASME.
															These include fittings, tubings, casing, valves, rods, etc.

														<b>Composite Underground Storage Tanks</b>
														<li>I designed a new composite storage tank according to ASME Section X standards.  This includes destructively testing the tank to validate the design.</li>
